# Frontend Mentor - Blogr landing page solution

This is a solution to the [Blogr landing page challenge on Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/blogr-landing-page-EX2RLAApP). Frontend Mentor challenges help you improve your coding skills by building realistic projects. 

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the site depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox

### What I learned

I was able to create a navbar from scratch for the first. Atleast I didn't depend on bootstrap this time. The Navbar was a challenge but am getting better at it.

### Continued development

- I'll need to continue working on my navbars
- I'll also need to start taking a mobile first approach to my work
